# Installation

This repository uses the [image](/.devcontainer/Dockerfile) named `rust:1.82` for running devcontainer.

1. Ensure you have Docker and Visual Studio Code with the Remote - Containers extension installed.
2. Clone the repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/PARKCHEOLHEE-lab/pyo3-geos.git
    ```

3. Open the project with VSCode.
4. When prompted at the bottom left on the VSCode, click `Reopen in Container` or use the command palette (F1) and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.
5. VS Code will build the Docker container and set up the environment.
6. Once the container is built and running, you're ready to start working with the project.

# Building Rust Code
After running the container, use the following command to compile the Rust code. The compiled code is generated in the target/wheels directory in \*.whl format, which can be installed using pip. For automation, the build.sh script includes `pip install target/wheels/"$NAME"-*.whl`.
```sh
sh build.sh rust_geos --release

# Testing

`test.py` tests a simple performance and accuracy test for the `buffer_erosion_and_dilation()` geometry operation using [python](./test.py) and [rust](./rust_geos/src/lib.rs).
Both Python's shapely library and Rust's geos library are based on the C GEOS library, and this test measures both implementations using the same parameters for the erode and dilate operations.

  duration_rs: 4.41597
